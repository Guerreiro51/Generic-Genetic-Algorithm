# Generic-Genetic-Algorithm
This is just a C++ implementation of a Generic Genetic Algorithm. Implemented a Singleton Class with all the information about the simulated population. 

Runs with an arbitrary mathematical function and finds its maximum using variable mutation rate. It also has a graphical user interface that shows each generation as the algorithm runs. The big red dot is the best fit individual and the green ones are his children, the function itself is shown in the background.

The program can also render some useful plots showing the population progress through the generations.
